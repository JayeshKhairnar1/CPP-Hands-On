1) store value 20 inside "num" variable.
create a pointer to this variable. print the value of "num" using pointer.
increment the pointer by 2 and show with the diagram what happens.

2) accept two numbers from the user and with the help of pointers perform following arithmetic operations:
	+   -    *   /
	[ diagram compulsory ]

3) accept two numbers and swap them without using third variable.

4) write "Call By Address" program [ using pointer ]

5) Given
	void disp(int,int*);
write a program to define above function and invoke it.

6) given
	        int num = 100;
		int* ptr = &num;
		++(*ptr);
		cout << num << endl;
		(*ptr)++;
		cout << num << endl;
		*(ptr++);
		cout << num << endl;
	
show with the help of diagram what happens in the above code


7) Given following functions:
	void disp1(int k);
	int disp2(char *);
	void disp3();
	double* disp4(char ch);

	declare "pointer to functions" for the above functions.


8) ask user how many numbers he would like to store and using DMA allocate the memory for the same [ diagram compulsory ]

 
	

9) given
	int arr[]={10,20,30,40,50}

write a function which can accept above array inside the pointer and using for loop traverse it.

10) given
	char name[20]="Computer"
	
	now declare a pointer to the above string and increment the pointer in such a way that when you display the string using pointer, it should display "puter"

11) accept a name ,display it. Now change first and the last characters of the name with their next characters and again print it.
e.g
	name is "sachin"
		output should be "tachio"

12) accept a name and print its length without using in built (strlen) function.
