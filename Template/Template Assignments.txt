1) Write a class (not a class template) and inside it create a function template as a member function. Invoke it from main function.

2)write a class template , which can take any generic type display it and return the size of type passed.

5) define a class "Emp" with "private int data=100"  
write a function template,which can accept anything as an argument and display it.
It can also accept "Emp" class object as an argument and display it
