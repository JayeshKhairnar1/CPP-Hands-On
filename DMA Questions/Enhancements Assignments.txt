1) using cin and cout, accept name,address,age of a person and print it.

2) create following structure
struct book
{
	char bid[5];
	char name[30];
	int price;
};
ask user how many records he wants to create and accordingly allocate memory.
accept values from user and display.
( Hint :-  use  "new" operator)



3) create a structure "Employee" 
with members 
	int id
	char name[20];
	char desig[20];
now access it using
a) array 
b) DMA

4) create a static library in C++ in which,
write a function which will accept 2 numbers and return the difference between 2 numbers
write appropriate header file.

write a client code to access this library.


5) given
	void disp(int); function.

now create a function pointer and call this function using function pointer.

6) write a function to swap 2 given numbers using pointers.




7) accept from user how many chracters he has in his name, now allocate a memory accordingly and accept his name. [use new operator]


8) write a function which can accept minimum 3 characters and maximum 5 characters and display them. ( use "default arguments")

9)write a function which takes 3 arguments
variable, pointer and a reference.(any datatype)
invoke this function and show how "call by value","call by address" and "call by reference" will work.

10)define 3 different structures and initialize their members.
now write 3 different functions,but with the same name.
these functions will accept each structure respectively and display their members.
